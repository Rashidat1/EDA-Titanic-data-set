Titanic Dataset â€” Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset using **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.

Tasks Performed
Basic Line Plot & Scatter Plot (Matplotlib):
  - Age vs Fare scatter plot
  - Fare trends by Age (line plot)
Distribution Visualizations (Seaborn):
  - Histograms of Age and Fare
  - Box plots grouped by Passenger Class and Sex

Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
  
 Insights from the analysis
- Younger passengers generally paid lower fares.
- Higher fares were associated with upper-class passengers.
- Box plots reveal clear differences in fare distribution across classes
